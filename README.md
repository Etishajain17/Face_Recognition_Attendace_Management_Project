# Face_Recognition_Attendace_Management_Project

###This project involves building an attendance system which utilizes facial recognition to mark the presence and time-in of employees. It covers areas such as facial detection, alignment, and recognition. This project intends to serve as an efficient substitute for traditional manual attendance systems. It can be used in corporate offices, schools, and organizations where security is essential.

This project aims to automate the traditional attendance system where the attendance is marked manually. It also enables an organization to maintain its records like in-time and attendance digitally. Digitalization of the system would also help in better visualization of the data using graphs to display the no. of employees present today and total work hours of each employee .
